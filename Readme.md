# MedPAO: A Protocol-Driven Agent for Structuring Medical Reports

## Overview

MedPAO is an intelligent agent system designed to process and structure medical radiology reports according to the standardized P.A.B.C.D.E.F protocol for chest x-ray interpretation. The system extracts medical concepts from free-text radiology reports, maps them to standard medical ontologies, and organizes them into a structured clinical format.

## Features

- Extracts key medical concepts from free-text reports
- Maps concepts to SNOMED CT and RADLEX medical ontologies
- Categorizes findings according to the P.A.B.C.D.E.F protocol
- Generates structured medical reports with standardized sections


## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Local LLM servers:
  - One server running on port 8080 for reasoning tasks
  - One server running on port 8081 for concept extraction
- Internet access (for BioPortal API calls)

## Installation

1. Cloning the repository and installing dependencies.
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd medpao-agent

# Install dependencies
pip install mcp-python-sdk pandas requests nltk tqdm huggingface_hub regex
```

2. Register and Get the Bioportal API access(https://bioportal.bioontology.org/). Enter the API key in `apis.json` file as:
```bash
{
    "API_KEY": "your api key"

}
```

3. To ensure local LLMs inference, refer to Huggingface TGI framework according to the available machines (https://huggingface.co/docs/text-generation-inference/en/index)

4. We use the following two models: 
- LLM engine : https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B
- concept extractor : https://huggingface.co/shrishSVaidya/medllama_finetuned

## Usage

1. Run the LLM engine on port 8080 of the machine via TGI.
```bash
# For example, on one node of Gaudi2 accelerator we run:
volume=/mnt/hf_model    #volume where the model weights are stored
model=deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B     #model-id
docker run --name deepseek_runner -p 8080:80    --runtime=habana    --cap-add=sys_nice    --ipc=host    -v $volume:/data    -e MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS=4056    -e BATCH_BUCKET_SIZE=256    -e PREFILL_BATCH_BUCKET_SIZE=4    -e RUST_LOG=debug    -e PAD_SEQUENCE_TO_MULTIPLE_OF=64    ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:3.2.3-gaudi    --model-id $model    --sharded true --num-shard 6    --max-input-tokens 6048 --max-total-tokens 8056    --max-batch-prefill-tokens 6096 --max-batch-size 2    --max-waiting-tokens 7 --waiting-served-ratio 1.2        #Command to start TGI server
```

2. Run the concept extractor model on port 8081 of the machine via TGI.

```bash
# For example, on one node of Gaudi2 accelerator we run:
volume=/mnt/hf_model    #volume where the model weights are stored
model=model_id      #finetuned concept extraction model
hf_token=...        #Huggingface access token for authorization
docker run --name medllama_runner -p 8081:80    --runtime=habana    --cap-add=sys_nice    --ipc=host    -v $volume:/data    -e MAX_TOTAL_TOKENS=3056    -e BATCH_BUCKET_SIZE=256    -e PREFILL_BATCH_BUCKET_SIZE=4 -e HF_TOKEN=$hf_token   -e RUST_LOG=debug    -e PAD_SEQUENCE_TO_MULTIPLE_OF=64    ghcr.io/huggingface/text-generation-inference:3.2.3-gaudi    --model-id $model    --sharded false    --max-input-tokens 1048 --max-total-tokens 3056    --max-batch-prefill-tokens 2096 --max-batch-size 8    --max-waiting-tokens 7 --waiting-served-ratio 1.2    #Command to start TGI server
```

3. Export the Bioportal API key
```bash
export API_KEY="your-api-key"
```
4. Run the MedPAO agent with prompt:
- If you want to utilize the local caching(for faster inference) then specify it in prompt:
```bash
python mcp_client.py --prompt "the task is to structure the given medical report according to ABCDEF protocol, utilizing the check_cache tool: {findings}"
```

- Similarly, if you dont want to use local caching:
```bash
python mcp_client.py --prompt "the task is to structure the given medical report according to ABCDEF protocol, without using check_cache tool: {findings}"
```

5. The system will process the medical reports defined in the `{findings}` placeholder of the above prompt.


## Project Structure

├── apis.json                 # json containing api key
├── mcp_client.py             # PAO agent implementation
├── mcp_server.py             # MCP server with medical processing tools
├── tools/                    # Processing tools

```
- The `cached_vocab.json` will have all unique concepts and their corresponding category according to the ABCDEF protocol and it will keep updating as and when the agent is used on multiple samples.

- The `apis.json` file is created to store the Bioportal API, so that the relevant tool would use it.

- The `mcp_client.py` and `mcp_server.py` contain the MedPAO agent implementation as described in the paper.

- The `tools` directory contains implementation of all the tools as described in the paper.

- The `savings` directory contains temporary files, containing the output of each tool execution for every sample.


## Outputs

The system generates several output files for each sample case in the `savings/` directory:

- `concepts_output.json`: Contains the output of `get_concept` tool, i.e., Extracted concepts and their source sentences from the given report
- `new_concepts_output.json`: Contains output of `check_cache` tool, i.e., Concepts not found in local cache ( `cached_vocab.json`)
- `ontologyMapping.csv` : Contains output of `ontology_mapping` tool, i.e.,Concepts alongwith their mapped ontologies and the heirarchy.
- `segregated.json` : Contains the output of `filter_ontologies` tool, i.e., PRIMARY and SECONDARY classification of mapped ontologies for each concept.
- `categorized_concepts.json`: Contains output of `categorize_concepts` tool, i.e., Categorized concepts according to specified protocol.
- `categorized_report.json`: Contains the output of `generate_report` tool, i.e., Final structured report.

  abstract  = {The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for structuring clinical
               data is critically hindered by their tendency to hallucinate facts and
               their inability to follow domain-specific rules. To address this, we
               introduce MedPAO, a novel agentic framework that ensures accuracy and
               verifiable reasoning by grounding its operation in established clinical
               protocols such as the ABCDEF protocol for CXR analysis. MedPAO
               decomposes the report structuring task into a transparent process
               managed by a Plan-Act-Observe (PAO) loop and specialized tools. This
               protocol-driven method provides a verifiable alternative to opaque,
               monolithic models. The efficacy of our approach is demonstrated through
               rigorous evaluation: MedPAO achieves an F1-score of 0.96 on the critical
               sub-task of concept categorization. Notably, expert radiologists and
               clinicians rated the final structured outputs with an average score of
               4.52 out of 5, indicating a level of reliability that surpasses baseline
               approaches relying solely on LLM-based foundation models. The code is
